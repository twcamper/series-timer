This was a collection of bash and ruby scripts that executed <code>/usr/bin/say</code> and <code>Audirvana</code> on a Mac.

As a language learning exercise, I've implemented it in C using <code>exec</code> shell-outs.  It now runs either <code>Audirvana</code> or <code>VLC</code> via another C project of mine, [prf](https://github.com/twcamper/prf).
